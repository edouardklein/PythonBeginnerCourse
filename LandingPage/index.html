        <p>To get started with our course, you should be comfortable with high
            school level mathematics and basic computer skills like understanding
            what windows and files are. No prior programming experience is
            required.</p>

        <p>Yes, it&apos;s essential. Our course is intensive and designed to maximize
            learning within a week. Clearing your schedule ensures you can fully

        <p>If you&apos;re referred by someone, enter their email in the "referred by"
            field on the signup form. You&apos;ll receive a 10% discount, and the person
            who referred you gets 10% of their payment back post-course. To refer
            someone, sign up and make sure they use your email address when they
            sign up. They save 10%, and you&apos;ll be refunded 10% of your fee after the
            course concludes.</p>
