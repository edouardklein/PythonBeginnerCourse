    <h2>Case study</h2>
    <p>By the time you have prepared your strategy to evaluate the sales pitch, two more people came up with a sales pitch of their own.</p>
    <p>You now have to choose between 5 sales pitch.</p>
    <p>The sales team managed to find 20 additionnal sales lead for you to try the pitches on</p>
    <h2>Meta information</h2>
    <p>This is your trial {{ nbtrial }} out of 3.</p>
    <p>To get a B or better you should get at least {{ benchmark }} sales lead to become customers.</p>
    <p>Your grade can not go down, only the best trial out of your three will be taken into account.</p>
    <p>In real life you would not know whether you had selected the best sales pitch, and you would only get one trial.</p>
    <h2>Choose your own adventure:</h2>
    <p>Which sales pitch are you going to show to lead number {{ lead-nb }} ?
