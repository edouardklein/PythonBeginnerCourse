    <p>My mother in law has a cabinet, the heigth of which is 77 cm.</p>
    <p>She can buy as many drawers of length 39 cm, 26 cm, 13 cm, and 17 cm as she needs.</p>
    <p>She want to know how many drawers of each size she can use, given that she can tolerate a leeway of 2 cm of unused space.</p>
    <p>In order to parse the answer, my mother in law needs to see:
        <ul>
            <li>one combination per line,</li>
            <li>within a combination, the drawers must be sorted in ascending order of height,</li>
            <li>the drawer heights must be separated by a comma,</li>
            <li>the order of combinations does not matter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So, for example, given that the input is:
        <ul>
            <li>Total height: 77 </li>
            <li>Available drawers: 39, 26, 13, 17</li>
            <li>Leeway: 2</li>
        </ul>
        the answer would be:
        <pre>
            17,17,17,26
            13,13,17,17,17
        </pre>
        If the leeway had been 5, the answer would have been:
        <pre>
            17,17,39
            13,17,17,26
            17,17,17,26
            13,13,13,17,17
            13,13,17,17,17
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>What are the combinations of drawer heights for the follwing input:
        <ul>
            <li>Total height: {{total}} </li>
            <li>Available drawers: {{drawers}}</li>
            <li>Leeway: {{leeway}}</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <form action="/drawer" method="post">
        <textarea name="answer" placeholder="The answer, e.g. 42"></textarea>
        <input name="token" type="hidden" value="{{ token }}">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <p><strong>Hints and tips:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html">the documentation of the itertools package</a>. 5 minutes of reading can save 10 minutes of coding.</li>
        <li>You can try as many times as you want, but you'll get different values each time.</li>
        <li>Focus on getting the right answer first, and then format it in a way my mother in law can understand</li>
        <li>Here is a code snippet, do with it what you will: <pre>",".join(map(str, sorted([1, 3, 2])))</pre></li>
    </ul>
